## Compare PSD
Repository to make use of the Power Spectral Density from the Welch and Astropi method to predict inhaled concentration of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), nitrogen dioxide (NO$_2$) and nitric oxide (NO). \
Each of the files has two different notebook. One of the notebook utilizes physiololgical responses and a Power spectral density obtained using Welch method, other notebook makes use of the same physiological responses and Power spectral density obtained using Astrapi Spectrum Analyzer created by Astrapi. The estimation using Welch method has WM in the file name. \
The data for CO$_2$ and NO is in the corresponding folder, the data for NO$_2$ is in the NO folder.
The cleaned data is also provided. The dataset consisting of PSD from ASA has ASA in its name, and the dataset where Welch method was utilized has WM in its name.
